                                  when-changed

                      Run a command when a file is changed


    ~ What is it?

      Tired of switching to the shell to test the changes you just made to
      your code? Starting to feel like a mindless drone, manually running
      pdflatex for the 30th time to see how your resume now looks?

      Worry not, when-changed is here to help! Whenever it sees that you have
      changed the file, when-changed runs any command you specify.

      So to generate your latex resume automatically, you can do this:

      $ when-changed CV.tex pdflatex CV.tex

      Sweetness!
